# homesweethome

This repository will contain the code needed for the webapp Home Sweet Home. 

The purpose of the webapp is to help me find a nice house here in the Netherlands by comparing the following aspects:

* Price
* Distance to transportation centers
* Commute to workplace
* Metrage
* Other features to be discussed 


On top of these webapp features, this should also help me learn data science, webscraping, fullstack development, and chatbot capabiilities
